# CS330
Practical software design and programming activities in a C/C++ and Unix environment, with emphasis on the details of C/C++ and good programming style and practices.
Coursework for CS 330 at the University of Oregon, taken Spring 2023. Topics include various practical applications of the C/C++ and Unix environments.

## Assignment 1
Usage of Linux directory entries and DIR* type streams to recursively locate a file of a given filename

## Assignment 2
File I/O in C - parsing and processing of integers from a file stream, saved to a file

## Assignment 3
Implementation of a sparse matrix-vector multiply in C, which takes an input of a matrix in COO (coordinate) format, converts it to CSR format, and multiplies it by a vector.

## Assignment 4
Implementation of a breadth-first search on a tree. Constructs an adjacency list and applies BFS and SpMV algorithms.

## Assignment 5
Reading and understanding of C++ code through "artificial intelligence" assignment - searches for input keywords and responds to them with given outputs

## Assignment 6
Encryption and decryption of text strings using various standards (substitution, Caesar, ROT13, running key, Vigenere) with a class-based construction in C++.
Cipher implementations use class inheritance and function overloading to utilize common functions.

## Assignment 7
Binary search tree class composed in C++, and a useful database class which inherits off of it.
