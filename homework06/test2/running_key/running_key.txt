the running key cipher has the same internal workings as the vigenere cipher
the difference lies in how the key is chosen
the vigenere cipher uses a short key that repeats whereas the running key cipher uses a long key such as an excerpt from a book
this means the key does not repeat making cryptanalysis more difficult
the cipher can still be broken though as there are statistical patterns in both the key and the plaintext which can be exploited
There is no such a thing as random numbers only pseudorandom numbers
